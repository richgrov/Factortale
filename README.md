# Factortale

![screenshot](.github/screenshot.png)

This was a simple JavaScript game created in a week during my second year of
high school that demonstrates factoring, inspired by Undertale. It utilitizes no
game engine, and features various inside jokes from the class that you probably
won't understand.
